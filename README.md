# eratosthenes

In this repo I'm trying to play around with Go and its concurrency features. I want to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is a famous and simple way of calculating prime numbers. In the first iteration I am doing this with a simple nested loop, but the plan is to use concurrency and channels to reduce the memory requirements and possibly speed up the process.
